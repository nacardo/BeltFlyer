General Info:
	Game is titled "Belt Flyer"
	Objective is to fly through an asteroid belt without hitting asteroids
	
Installation:
	Need to have Pygame installed.
	Please see Pygame's documentation for help installing:
		https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

Exiting the game:
	During intro/winner/loser screens the game uses pygame delays
	If the 'x' is hit during this time it will seem as if the game is not responding
	Exiting once actual game is in progress is recommended
